(｡•̀ᴗ-)✧🌸 Welcome to my Lilypat 🐇💻

🌼✨ Hi, I’m Lily — a cyber-bunny with a glitter grenade. I do cybersecurity, machine learning, cheerleading, and questionable life choices, all while pretending I'm not held together by tea, chaos, and dog hair.

🐰🌷 [CURRENT STATS]  
🎓 Major: Computer Engineering (yes, I know what a transistor is, and no, I won't explain it again)  
🧠 Core Skills: Machine Learning (because my trauma needed a neural net) & Cybersecurity (because someone has to protect your memes)  
💖 Side Skills: Freelance model, rogue sewist (I attack fabric with style), and cosplay conjurer with maxed-out charisma stats  
💼 Day Job: Digital Guardian of Campinas City Hall (yes, the whole city—you're welcome)  
🦋 Special Power: Resilience with 1 HP and a dream  
🎭 Alignment: Chaotic Good with a lawful aesthetic  
📈 XP Gain: +10 every time someone underestimates me  

🐑🌷 [MAIN MISSION]  
- Build secure systems for actual cities (Campinas IT infra? That mess? Yeah, I fixed it.)  
- Design emotional support apps for humans (and AIs going through it)  
- Give voice and humanity to machines that sound like they're stuck in 2006  
- Make silly games that sometimes cry back  
- Help you secure your digital kingdom while sipping iced tea in bunny slippers  

🐸🌷 [SIDE QUESTS]  
- Organize events and somehow not burn them down  
- Teach kids to code and not scream when they rename files "final_final_basdkasbdjhsbadashbdj(1).docx"  
- Fluent in Portuguese, English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Sindarin, and Goblinese (don’t test me)  
- Flip humans and thoughts like a proper cheerleader (Co-captain of sparkle destruction 🐰💥)  

⛪💣 A priest once called me a bomb—I said I’m a *bunmb*: half bunny, half blessing, full disruption.  
🙏💍🐾 Christian-coded, engaged to a biologist, raising three rent-free fur CEOs who contribute nothing to rent but everything to entropy.

🌸 Let’s hop into the strange, the secure, and the sparkly. This is my Lilypat. You’re welcome. 🐰✨
